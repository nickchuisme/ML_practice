1.	Split the data into training and test sets
2.	#Calculate prior probabilities of hypotheses.
3.	For each sample in the training set:
4. 		If sample pertains to hypothesis [i]:
5.			Increment a count for hypothesis [i]
6.	For each hypothesis[i]:
7.		Prior probability [i] = count for hypothesis[i] / (no. samples in training set)
8.	#Calculate likelihood.
9.	Limit training data to fewer features
10.	For each sample in the training set:
11.		If sample pertains to hypothesis [i]:
12.			For each feature[k]:
13.				Increment a count for each feature value[j] for hypothesis [i]
14.	For each feature[k]:
15.		For each hypothesis[i]:
16.			For each feature value[j]:
17.				count for feature value[k][i][j] = count for feature value[k][i][j] / count for hypothesis[i]
18.	#Prediction on test data.
19.	For each sample in the test set:
20.		For each hypothesis[i]:
21.			For each feature[k]
22.				Posterior probability[i] = Posterior probability[i] * count for feature value[k][i][test sample feature value]
23.			Posterior probability[i] = Posterior probability[i] * Prior probability[i]
24.		Prediction = Maximum hypothesis(Posterior probability) 
25.		If Prediction is correct:
26.			Increment count of correct score.
